# LEETCODE-Array-840
Let's go through a dry run of the `numMagicSquaresInside` method in the `Solution` class with an example grid to understand how it works.

### Example Grid:
```java
int[][] grid = {
    {4, 3, 8, 4},
    {9, 5, 1, 9},
    {2, 7, 6, 2},
    {5, 5, 5, 5}
};
```

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `ans = 0` (This variable will store the count of magic squares).
   - The outer loop starts iterating over the grid rows (`i` from 0 to `grid.length - 3`), and the inner loop iterates over the grid columns (`j` from 0 to `grid[0].length - 3`).

2. **Outer loop (i = 0):**
   - **Inner loop (j = 0):**
     - Check if `grid[0][0] % 2 == 0` (i.e., `4 % 2 == 0`, which is true) and `grid[1][1] == 5` (i.e., `5 == 5`, which is true).
     - Since both conditions are true, call `isMagic(grid, 0, 0)`.

3. **isMagic method:**
   - Initialize an empty string `s = ""`.
   - For the elements in `new int[] {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 7, 6, 3}`, concatenate the corresponding values from the grid to `s`:
     - `s += grid[0 + 0][0 + 0]` → `s = "4"`
     - `s += grid[0 + 1][0 + 1]` → `s = "49"`
     - `s += grid[0 + 2][0 + 2]` → `s = "498"`
     - `s += grid[0 + 5 / 3][0 + 5 % 3]` → `s = "4987"`
     - `s += grid[0 + 8 / 3][0 + 8 % 3]` → `s = "49876"`
     - `s += grid[0 + 7 / 3][0 + 7 % 3]` → `s = "498762"`
     - `s += grid[0 + 6 / 3][0 + 6 % 3]` → `s = "4987621"`
     - `s += grid[0 + 3 / 3][0 + 3 % 3]` → `s = "49876213"`
   - After the loop, `s = "49876213"`.
   - Check if `s` is a substring of `"4381672943816729"` or `"9276183492761834"`:
     - `s` is not a substring of either, so return `false`.

4. **Back to the main method:**
   - Since `isMagic` returned `false`, `ans` is not incremented.
   - **Inner loop (j = 1):** This loop doesn't satisfy the conditions, so `isMagic` isn't called.
   - The inner loop ends for `i = 0`.

5. **Outer loop (i = 1):** This iteration doesn't satisfy the conditions, so no `isMagic` call occurs.

6. **Outer loop (i = 2):** Similarly, no valid checks are satisfied here.

7. **Final Step:**
   - The outer loop ends, and the function returns `ans`, which is `0`.

### Summary:
The method checks each 3x3 subgrid in the larger grid to see if it forms a magic square. For a subgrid to be considered, the top-left value must be even, and the center value must be 5. It then verifies if the sequence of grid values matches one of the predefined magic square patterns. If none match, `ans` remains 0, indicating no magic squares were found.
